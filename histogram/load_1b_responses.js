He sighed and closed the box, beginning to carry it out the door with a somber look. Let’s go back a few hours, when ten got to his office. The door slammed open with a poised, confident, and for SURE cool (imagine him with shades) algebralien. Some of the numbers working at their cubicles got up and crowded around clamoring, all with grins to greet the employee of the month (or every month). Ten straightened his tie and said simple and cool greetings, giving a little finger gun to eight, who did it back. As he made it to his self-reserved office, scatting to a rhythm he made in his head, when he looked up and meets himself with a paper (stuck on his door). Three words was all it took to make him drop the keys in his hand. His eyes widened as he slowly took the paper in his hand. “what is… this..?” as his eyes gave quick glances at the paper, a feeling of dread creeped onto the orange-colored number. ‘TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT’ it read, but why? As far as he knew he was the coolest guy there! (sorry nine). As he finished reading the additional paragraph on the page, he opened the door and flopped down onto a chair (spinning chair to be exact!) and stared at the paper for about half an hour, wondering what he did to make it end this way. Fast forward five hours to where he finally got himself to start packing his stuff miserably. Fast forward just another hour to where he finishes packing and here we are! With a sad looking number, poor guy. At this point, he was just tired and wanted to get home. Stepping up to the door of his house, ten looked for his keys, slowly realizing he left them on the floor, ALL THE WAY BACK AT HIS OFFICE…. his sadness channeled to anger as he was this close to losing it, when he suddenly realized his door wasn’t locked but open? ‘Why would I leave my door open?’ he thought, feeling a little more nervous little by little. ‘A burglar? A loose killer? FOURTEEN?!’ His eyes widened as he slowly creaked the door open, expecting the worst. POP! He jolted at the sudden noise, and looking up in surprise as he sees confetti falling down on him. “huh?..” He gasped as the lights turned on and all of his co-workers jumping out with a big sign that read ‘CONGRATULATIONS, 11!!!’. Ten was surprised and confused, but both of those feelings faded away as he began to smile while they crowded around. Six slapped a party hat on him, “hey, congrats!”, followed by the others lining up with their own gift in congratulating him of the promotion. “but.. didn’t i just get fired?” he asked five, who replied with a slight bit of sarcasm lacing her tone, “fired? hmm,,  Oh! We just had to find a way for you to get home early, because SOME OF US.. couldn’t wait.” With a laugh of relief, ten pulled them into a group hug, beaming. “you guys.. x̄ so much to me”	15983	0.1733	0.2707");
