After seeing Ixcors' drawing of PSSSSS-ers and JustAToadBB's drawing of SSSDSS-ers,
I decided to do it for my own path (SPSSSS as of R6) since they looked really cool.
Also I wanted to see more people drawing their pathmates
so I felt like I had to set a precedent.
</p>
<p class = "text_center caption">
I drew it in 2024 Sep 17, and it's a bit rushed since I wanted to get it done before 7A's release.
The total drawing time is about 5 hours.
Also EWOW 7A came out less than 24 hours after this was posted on TC,
so nobody new drew their pathmates in a comparable scale :(

EWOW Elimination Cards Video Thumbnails
</h2>

<p class = "text_center caption">
The elimination cards videos originally had their thumbnail arts taken directly from the EWOW episodes,
however it's not a good practice since I never asked for permission (I'm sorry EWOW team).
One day I was taking a stroll and thought of redrawing the thumbnail arts
with the episode hosts doing something relevant to the prompt.
So I redrew them all within a few days.
Each thumbnail art took about 1-2 hours, depending on how complicated the hosts' book designs are.
</p>
<p class = "text_center caption">
You can see the thumbnail arts as the result of me tryharding while the pathmate arts as me rushing.

<p class = "text_center caption">
Also I didn't remake the EWOW 3B elimination cards' thumbnail, Scary Cary is too iconic to change.
