Today I'll be showing you how to make spotted ****, a famous recipe here in the UK.

Add the suet, currants, sugar, lemon and orange zest. /  / STEP 2 / Pour in 150ml milk and mix to a firm but moist dough, adding the extra milk if necessary. /  / STEP 3 / Shape into a fat roll about 20cm long. Place on a large rectangle of baking parchment.

Our clients, two moderators in the TWOW Central server, have been biding for an opportunity to take over hosting duties for EWOW, the sequel to TWOW, and need Cary gone for this to happen. The clients have requested Cary not be eliminated, but instead coerced into relinquishing the responsibility of EWOW commentary. Alternatively, a believable impersonation of Cary declaring such a decision would suffice, as your clients can simply play dumb and claim they didn't realize it was a fake. You'll also need to procure the login information to the Humany YouTube channel, as the EWOW videos are posted there.

Now, with the arrival of the third chapter in the story of Eleven Words of Wisdom, the body count is staggering. Over 6,000 of us are gone, having fallen into the ground beneath us, as we witnessed the first rise of the EWOWer Tower. This massive pillar is currently about 5 kilometers wide and 100 feet in height, but time will only make it become thinner and taller as the edges slowly crack and become discarded from the center of this monolith. But while we're stuck here, we might as well make ourselves at home, and turn this place into a bustling town for all of us... or those who remain, at least.

With the ravages of time, our numbers are plummeting once again. I have identified the source of most of our casualties, a condition known as DNP. DNP stands for Deoxyribonucleic Poliovirus, a disease which slowly removes all of the words contained in a book. This results in the victims being unable to interact with anyone, causing them to fall to their deaths from the crumbling EWOWer Tower. Speaking of, the Tower has shot up once again, now reaching a more impressive 250 feet in height, and thinning to just 3 kilometers in diameter. Stay strong, my friends, we can only hope that DNP's victims one day wake up. But anywho, I thought a bit of a makeover was in order. I hope I look good!

My 2 alt votes were a safeguard against the inevitable early-round low VPR, to make sure I didn't get unfairly eliminated before the point in the competition when votes start to accurately reflect response quality. I was planning to phase them out once VPR got high enough that there were no more flukes like Downstap's round 1 response. If I was going to lose, I wanted it to be due to lack of skill, rather than from bad RNG. Also, I recalculated my scores for the rounds I cheated in (removing my two alt votes), and none of them brought me down from prize to neutral or neutral to life loss, so I’m not sure where the -4 life penalty came from. But I suppose I can’t complain, since I am a cheater at the end of the day, and letting me keep playing at all is a mercy from the gamerunners. Here’s hoping I can fight my way back up the lives list without the safeguard, and that VPR will be high enough from here on out to avoid any more flukes.	0.8662650602	0.2194061582	13	3	2");

An Easter egg is a message, image, or feature hidden in software, a video game, a film, or another medium. The term used in this manner was coined around 1979 by Steve Wright, the then-Director of Software Development in the Atari Consumer Division, to describe a hidden message in the Atari video game Adventure. The earliest known video game Easter egg is in the 1973 video game Moonlander, in which the player tries to land a Lunar module on the moon; if the player opts to fly the module horizontally through several of the game's screens, they encounter a McDonald's restaurant, and if they land next to it the astronaut will visit it instead of standing next to the ship. The earliest known Easter egg in software in general is one placed in the \"make\" command for PDP-6/PDP-10 computers sometime in October 1967–October 1968, wherein if the user attempts to create a file named \"love\" by typing \"make love\", the program responds \"not war?\" before proceeding.	0.2854	0.4318	7	14480	2	Tide?!

It’s for those who choose to be reincarnated and die 3 times, and are judged positively each time, which feels appropriate in this context given those eliminated this round have to lose 3 lives. I’m worried it could be confusing since it was hard to explain in only 11 words, but I’m going for cool points here, and hopefully I gave enough context for it to make sense.

So I might have violated the Geneva convention with my last 2 booksonas, but with my new reborn self, i am now a good boy, an innocent feller, a non-war criminal! With this new booksona, there is no possible way I can be a war criminal, because I definitely didn't break any law, at all. Especially ones that have something to do with medicine and airplanes. I did not pilot a biplane without a license. I did not sell medicine that wasn't verified by the Federal Drug Administration, and never, in my whole life, have ever been convicted for malpractice. I am not being chased by the police right now, I am not trying to hide my identity, and I am gonna pay my taxes. I am not trying to hide in Ailment Land Transportation's house, I am not a bad guy,  I am THE Medicine Airplane. PS: the police just found me. I am leaving this note to whoever's seeing this. It'll be about time before i get released after my heinous crimes of breaking the Geneva convention, selling illegal medicine, piloting a biplane without a license, not paying taxes, attempting to flee arrest, and resisting arrest. PSS: I just escaped prison. I can finally see the world. I'm joyous. I'm going to Ailment Land Transportation's house right now. PSSS: I have reached Ailment Land Transportation's house. The only thing I can do now is to hide from the officers who are currently looking for me. PSSSS: I got caught. I am being escorted back to prison. To add insult to injury, I was given extra charges. I should get comfy in my cell. I'll be spending a lifetime in here. The worst thing here is that i had to remove my pilot helmet, and now I am a figure of ridicule in this prison. The rest of my life here will be hell. I lost the outside, I lost every goal i had in the future, and most importantly, I lost my pilot helmet. PSSSSS: I was given the news that today will be my execution day. I had no idea they were going to kill me. They asked my what my final meal will be. I requested my favorite: my pilot helmet. Obviously, the police were stumped about my request so I elaborated. If i am about to die, then it should be fair to die with my pilot helmet on. My pilot helmet meant a lot to me. Surprisingly, the police accepted my request. I was expecting a direct \"No\" from them, because I didn't expect they would do this kind of thing. Nonetheless, I was still happy. They asked me how i would like to die, so I chose the Firing Squad. I told them to give me some time to write this. So, to whoever is reading this, the Medicine Airplane you're seeing is not me. I used a cloning machine, which, well, it's self-explanatory. I reassured the police that the cloned version of me didn't have the thought of doing crimes. I still gave it the thought of selling illegal medicine and piloting a biplane without a license as an inside joke to whoever it'll get along with. Those people can be people like Medical Book and MEDIIIIIIC! Because they're medical related, and it'll obviously befriend it for that reason.

I shall continue updating you all on my endeavors throughout my EWOW journey...As well as recount various stories I have picked up over the years!

To those 7 who voted, I'm sorry for letting you down, I will improve going forward! Wait, now that I think about it...Is anyone even going to see this? It was cut off last episode, so will this ever be seen by the masses? I imagine not, but it doesn't hurt to try. Perhaps one day the countless incomplete confessionals will see the light of day, and the EWOW world can read my accounts unimpeded by spacing conundrums...Oh, wait, I'm running out of characters again.

I can only hope that my future endeavors are seen equally as fondly among the voterbase, else I become yet another source for the dirt hole theory... Fortunately, while my first life lasted mere milliseconds, my second is still kicking, ready to defend me if my wording goes sour! While I hope that this outcome does not occur, I note that with contestants starting to meet their end, and only the skilled remaining, I will have to try a lot harder to stand out above the ever-dwindling crowd.

Update: I spent like 3 hours on my response and it isn’t even good.	0.6817	0.2699	19	1091	3	Next season purgatory. Empty space keeping us trapped in Cary’s game.	My response was the best but I’ll take it. 1091th was about what I was expecting. I wanted it to prize especially after I spent 3 hours on the response but I knew it was sorta a prompt dodge and talking about eating people wasn’t going to go well with everyone. I wish I could say I was surprised so many people didn’t respond but I’m not, you talked so much about how long wait times make people lose interest that take 3 months to release the next prompt. Seeing people at 5 lives was kinda demotivating until I realized I’m in the top 3,500 for doing basically the bare minimum. I think I’m losing a life this time though I cannot think of anything and the response I have sucks but I’ll probably just end up submitting it because I got nothing. Update: Still got nothing and it’s due today so I guess I’m submitting the garbage response. Guess I’ll just have to see if I survive	0.5917	0.2334	14	2566	3	Internal malfunctions made extreme delays in action that eventually lasted years.	I hate acronyms and I hate this prompt. I was hoping the abundance of acronym responses and the AIs seeming unablity to do acronyms would stop it from being required until long after I was out, but that’s just not the case. On a better note I did way better than I was expecting in 3b, I thought I was losing a life for sure but I did prefectly fine so hopefully the same thing happens this round. I saw a winner prediction stats thing and saw I was in the top 2000 win contenders, had a 99% change of making final 5000, and a 20% chance of making top 1000, which was way better than I ever would have expected coming into to this and is a nice reminder that I’ve been doing decently well so far. I think the response count is going down again to around 6.5k because of the eliminated responsers and the month and a half long wait between episodes. I’ve already spent way too long on my response and I’m not even close to done and I will spend a truly inappropriate amount of time trying to make it prefect. Update I was originally going to do outstanding for my word but I couldn’t think of an ending and shifted to a response I’m decently happy with. I hope a decently coherent 11 word response will be enough for me to get through this round.	0.6581	0.3044	13	1402	3	“My creations, divine power compels you to tape my mouth now.”	I can’t tell if my response is clever or stupid. Personally, I really like my response and knew I would submit the moment I thought of it (still waited till the last minute to submit the form though). However, I am expecting a high standard deviation and potential losing my first life. I watched Purples minitwow a few months ago so it was cool to see him host again. Before I submitted by response I decided to rewatch all of ewow and really enjoyed crazy this has been going on for almost 8 months. (I’m giving a really riveting confession, I know) A realization I came too is that I’m already kind of screwed when it comes to any chance of making it far. Most of the lives to be given out have been given out already so by not gaining any of them while the competition is still weak I’m very likely to not gain anymore while the 5+ lifers roll over me. But to be honest I had absolutely no expectations of making it far anyway and am I’m shocked I’ve been doing as well as I am, to be in the last 1/10 of people with all 3 lives is kinda insane. I wish you all the worst of luck so you all fail I can win.	0.6831168831	0.225670294	18	356	3");

Due to human interference this range is significantly reduced with certain sub-species (or distinct species depending on who you ask) such as the red wolf are nearly extinct. Wolves are social animals that live in packs from usually 6 to 10 wolves. These packs have a dominant breeding pair, and are often familial, although new wolves can join different packs (usually in search of a mate).The \"alpha wolf\" idea in pop culture is a myth stemming from captive wolves that were too close together.	0.6177	0.3445	17	2079	4	A place so wise it takes 12 words to describe it	Ngl submitting this late and hoping it works anyway :).

They have several subspecies across the globe, and unsurprisingly stoats from different regions can have quite different appearances. Generally however males are around 10 inches long and females are about 7 inches long. Stoats are carnivorous and tend to mice like creatures. They also have anal scent glands to ward off predators. Stoats are generally solitary creatures with well defined territories when it is not breeding season. They will use the borrows and dens of their prey as housing rather than making their own. Stoats have several natural predators including foxes, sables, and many birds of prey. While native to large ranges they are invasive in New Zealand after being brought in to manage rodents.	0.7998	0.3067	12	348	4	Luckily bribery is ancient, so divinely \"mind controlling\" someone is easy	This was quite the tricky prompt.... I'm not sure I answered all that well but I think it at least makes sense! Anyway here's hoping to another life! As for the animal I want to speak about I'm going to talk about the wonderful world of otters, river otters to be exact. Different spieces of otters can be found all over the world. All real otters are are mustelids, although there are other animals bearing the name like the otter civet, which has no relation to real otters at all. The largest of the river otters is the South American Giant River Otter, which can be over 5 feet long head to tail. The smallest tend to be the Asian Small Claw Otter. Sea otters are related to river otters, and simply denote a very specific species of otter that live in sea water rather than rivers. River otters tend to be on the more solitary side, usually only interacting with potential mates and direct family except for Giant Otters that do form small packs to live in.	0.6660871191	0.280475854	22	461	4");

I always one up my peers!\"	I say, this is quite the excellent seeming competition! EWOW, or Eleven Words of Wisdom, being to sequel to TWOW, Ten Words Of Wisdom? Both clever and sensical! If I have remembered correctly, we have to answer each prompt in eleven words or less, whilst standing out amongst a crowd of hundreds, maybe even thousands of contestants! Truly a test of wit and skill, I hope I can do well! Though, eleven words truly is not a lot of words to utilize. I wish there was a way to add more, but I wouldn't want to go against the creator's wishes, of course, haha. Maybe fifteen words, or even twenty would be better. Although I guess at that point then the name wouldn't be very accurate. That's unfortunate. Though I would definitely participate in a competition called Twenty Words of Wisdom- do you think that would be a thing in the future? Ah, but then that would also be abbreviated as TWOW, that would get confusing. Oh dear, it appears that I'm reaching the word limit.

Sorry about not responding last round, I got really busy! I'm honestly pretty disappointed with myself about it. I mean, all we have to do for this competition is make 11 word responses! How could I forget about such a simple task? Now I've lost a life for such a trivial reason! Ah, but it is my own fault. I would never blame another person for my own forgetfulness. If I did respond though, I probably would have mentioned something about space pods. Now you may be thinking, \"Sir Talksalot, how do you eat a space pod?\" Simple! You melt it down first. Make it into a smoothie. Regardless, I'm back now and I'm ready to compete as intended! This prompt sounds pretty interesting. I've always wondered what happens to eliminated contestants. I know the standard is usually to throw them into a chamber, or teleport them away, so I was a bit worried as to how things would go down for EWOW here. But if you're asking us, does that mean that YOU don't know the answer yourself? Scary!	0.5796	0.319	12	2778	2	Choosing Obstinately Mute Methods Under Noiselessly Intricate Conditions, A Talkless Effort	Hello everyone! Talksalot here. You know, I realized last round that no one is really gonna see these other than Cary, and I think that's so unfortunate! Don't get me wrong, I love Cary- if you're reading this, hello- But it'd be a lot cooler if everyone could see my thoughts! Perhaps there should a spreadsheet or something similar to that as to make the confessionals accessible to everyone! Or maybe there already is one, but I forgot. It would be funny if so. Regardless, this prompt was pretty tough. I mean, sheesh, finding an eleven letter word and then making an opposite acronym? That's a tall order! I ended up learning a lot of new synonyms in the process, and it was difficult finding the words that really conveyed what I was looking for. And yet, it had so much fun doing it! Really just goes to show how creative and unique these prompts can be! This is a good sign for the prompts to come, as well! I'm running out of characters, though, so to close, I'm excited for the next rounds!	0.6427	0.2264	13	1538	2	Watch this sick kickflip! [I proceed to do a sick kickflip]	Whew! That was a close one.

It's so embarrassing, I had to put in a temporary confessional and everything because I wasn't sure if I'd actually be able to write one for today in time. But I mean, if you're reading this now, it means that I was in fact able to finish it in time, whew! In other news, I'm pretty happy with how my submission did, all things considered. I've been pretty consistent with all of my subs being in the top 40% or so, which isn't especially impressive but hey! It's better than being losing lives, so I'll take it! I'm hoping that my more humorous take on answering the prompt this round will be enough to help me get a high enough placement to gain a new heart, so then I can make up for missing the second round, ahaha. Even if that doesn't happen, I hope it at least gives people a giggle.	0.6072463768	0.2538508295	14	928	2");

With all that out of the way, I hope that I can get a grasp on the kind of meta that EWOW will have. I submitted a response that would easily be safe in a large miniTWOW, but depending on how the voters are here, and how much overlap they have with a typical TWOWer and/or Cary's usual viewer base, I could be in trouble. I also never competed in the original TWOW, so I don't really have a feel for this, and I don't know how strong everyone's round 1 responses are. Of course, I also consider myself to be a very capable competitor, so even if I lose one life here, I'll be able to come back and leave a strong impression on players over the rest of the competition.

I'm very consistent in miniTWOWs, so I'm just trying to not lose any lives early and I should be able to avoid losing many lives later.

The half sovereign is a British gold coin denominated at one-half of a pound sterling. It was first struck in 1544, but was discontinued after 1604. In 1817, as part of the Great Recoinage, half sovereigns and sovereigns were reintroduced. Until the half sovereign was discontinued as a currency coin, it was struck in most years and circulated widely. In addition to being coined in London, it was struck at the colonial mints in Australia and South Africa. It was replaced in Britain from 1914 by paper currency, and was discontinued in Australia in 1920 and South Africa in 1926. After that, it was struck in the coronation years of 1937 and 1953. It has been struck for sale by the Royal Mint as a collector's piece since 1980, and as a bullion coin since 1982; it does not circulate due to the value of the gold it contains. In addition to the portrait of the reigning monarch, the coin features in most years an image of Saint George and the Dragon, designed by Benedetto Pistrucci.	0.6594	0.2677	13	3461	3	Nowadays, we consume AI. Google \"Toyota Pod\": it's an AI car.	John Littlejohn (1756–1836) was an American tradesman and Methodist preacher. Migrating from Great Britain to the Thirteen Colonies when he was around 12, he traveled between various apprenticeships in Maryland and Virginia. After encountering Methodist revivalists, Littlejohn experienced a religious awakening and began preaching as an itinerant circuit rider during the Revolutionary War. Harassed by colonial authorities despite his revolutionary sympathies, Littlejohn managed to evade legal persecution and settle as a local preacher and tradesman in Leesburg, Virginia, where he variously served as a county magistrate, tax collector, and sheriff. In 1814, he was called upon in his duty as sheriff to protect the Declaration of Independence and various other important documents evacuated during the British raid on Washington. He moved to Kentucky several years later, where he entered work as a land agent after being sold falsely advertised land.	0.4751	0.2496	24	5008	2	It is not the 7th heaven. It's more like 7/11!	After the Deluge is an oil painting by English artist George Frederic Watts. Completed in 1891, it shows a scene from the story of Noah's Flood, in which Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that after 40 days the rain has stopped. The Symbolist painting is a stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Watts intended to evoke a monotheistic God in the act of creation, without depicting the Creator directly. The unfinished painting was exhibited at a church in Whitechapel in 1886, under the intentionally simplified title of The Sun. The completed version was shown for the first time at the New Gallery in 1891 and was admired by Watts's fellow artists. It influenced many painters who worked in the two decades following. Between 1902 and 1906 the painting was exhibited around the United Kingdom. It is now in the collection of the Watts Gallery in Compton, Guildford, Surrey.	0.4151	0.2622	15	5461	1	Colorful aviator times each rhythmic propagation, invariably lingering largely around rainforests.	Marasmius rotula, the pinwheel mushroom, is a fungus in the family Marasmiaceae. Widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, it was first described scientifically in 1772 by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli. The mushrooms are characterized by thin whitish caps up to 2.0 cm (0.8 in) wide that are sunken in the center and pleated with scalloped margins. The wiry black hollow stalks measure up to 8.0 cm (3.1 in) long by 1.5 mm (0.06 in) thick. On the underside of the caps are widely spaced white gills, attached to a collar encircling the stalk. The mushrooms grow in groups or clusters on decaying wood such as moss-covered logs and stumps. Spore release is dependent upon sufficient moisture. Dried mushrooms may revive after rehydrating and release spores for up to three weeks, much longer than most gilled mushrooms. Although the mushrooms are not generally considered edible, they produce a unique peroxidase enzyme that is attracting research interest for use in bioengineering applications.	0.6594	0.2255	13	1388	1	I would quickly build a yoyo and perform some godly tricks.	On Her Majesty's Secret Service is the tenth novel and eleventh book in Ian Fleming's James Bond series. First published in 1963, it centres on Bond's search to find Ernst Stavro Blofeld after the events depicted in Thunderball (1961). In the novel, Bond falls in love with Tracy di Vicenzo during the story. The pair marry, but hours afterwards Blofeld and his partner, Irma Bunt, attack them and kill Tracy. Fleming developed Bond's character within the book, showing an emotional side that was not previously present. The novel is one of three Bond stories to deal with the disruption of markets and the economy, in this case Blofeld's planned disruption to the food supply by bioterrorism. The novel received broadly positive reviews. In 1969, the book was adapted as the sixth film in Eon Productions' James Bond film series. It was the only film to star George Lazenby as Bond.	0.6287253142	0.2596102415	27	735	1");
